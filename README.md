## ML_PROJECTS
Welcome to my **Machine Learning Projects** repository! This collection includes various machine learning projects I've worked on as part of my learning journey and practical experience in data science.

# Repository Structure

Each folder in this repository contains a standalone machine learning project with the following:

# 1.Credit Risk Analysis

This project involves analyzing and predicting credit risk using the German Credit dataset. The goal is to classify individuals as having either good or bad credit risk based on features such as age, job type, housing situation, savings, checking account balance, credit amount, and loan purpose.

The project workflow includes:

> Data cleaning and missing value imputation

> Label encoding of categorical variables

> Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

> Correlation and distribution analysis

> Model training with multiple classification algorithms such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression

> Evaluation using accuracy and classification reports

This analysis helps financial institutions assess the likelihood of a customer defaulting on credit, aiding in better decision-making and risk management.

# 2.Customer Behaviour Classification

This project focuses on predicting whether a customer will purchase a product based on demographic data using machine learning models. The dataset includes information like customer ID, gender, age, and estimated salary, along with a binary outcome for whether the product was purchased.

The project workflow includes:

> Data cleaning and preprocessing

> Encoding categorical features

> Exploratory data analysis and visualizations

> Model training using classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, and Random Forest

> Performance comparison of models

> GUI deployment using Tkinter
