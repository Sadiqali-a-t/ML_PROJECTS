## ML_PROJECTS
Welcome to my **Machine Learning Projects** repository! This collection includes various machine learning projects I've worked on as part of my learning journey and practical experience in data science.

# Repository Structure

Each folder in this repository contains a standalone machine learning project with the following:

# 1.Customer Behaviour Classification

This project focuses on predicting whether a customer will purchase a product based on demographic data using machine learning models. The dataset includes information like customer ID, gender, age, and estimated salary, along with a binary outcome for whether the product was purchased.

The project workflow includes:

> Data cleaning and preprocessing

> Encoding categorical features

> Exploratory data analysis and visualizations

> Model training using classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, and Random Forest

> Performance comparison of models

> GUI deployment using Tkinter
